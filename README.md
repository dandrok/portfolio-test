# portfolio-test website

### Created from scratch, that is:
1. Wirefram and prototype in adobe xd
2. Added font and color scheme later
3. Entirely responsive

### Technologies:
* HTML
* SCSS
* Vanilla JavaScript
* [Tippy.js](https://github.com/atomiks/tippyjs)

### Conclusion:
The project has a lot of white space - I know that and it was the intended effect. moreover, the section with projects was not supplemented with projects. The whole project from scratch to start took about 10 hours, including the prototype and code writing. Overall, this project allowed me to use my knowledge: using css grid/flexbox, transitions, RWD, web design and prototyping.
