# portfolio-test website

### Created from scratch, that is:
1. Wirefram and prototype in adobe xd
2. Added font and color scheme later
3. Entirely responsive

### Technologies:
* HTML
* SCSS
* Vanilla JavaScript
* [Tippy.js](https://github.com/atomiks/tippyjs)

### Conclusion:
The project has a lot of white space - I know that and it was the intended effect. moreover, the section with projects was not supplemented with projects.
Great fun - the whole project from scratch to start took about 10 hours, including the prototype and code writing.
